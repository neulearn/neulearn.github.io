Ever wondered how to reduce higher dimensional data to a lower-dimensional data to visualize it better?


Possible to interpret this image?

It's a 10-D cube and it's hard to visualize this figure.

Humans can only visualize 1D, 2D, and 3D spaces. Even though we live in a 3D world, our eyes can see only in 2D. Our retina has a 2D surface and it's the 2D projection of 3D objects we are looking at. So, in order to get a clear view of N-dimensional data, one needs to have an (N-1)-dimensional retina surface and would see the N-dimensional objects as (N-1)-dimensional projections. Practically, this ain't possible.

Principal Component Analysis generally termed as PCA, is a handy solution for solving the dimensionality problem. Following the above quote by Robert Collier, one has to visualize and understand the data prior to building a model.

PCA helps to remove the features with less variance. Consider a simple example of dataset with only two features. One of the features representing the blackness of hair and the other feature being the weight of an individual. All the data points are from Indians.
