### Ever wondered how to reduce higher dimensional data to a lower-dimensional data to visualize it better?


Possible to interpret this image?

It's a 10-D cube and it's hard to visualize this figure.

Humans can only visualize 1D, 2D, and 3D spaces. Even though we live in a 3D world, our eyes can see only in 2D. Our retina has a 2D surface and it's the 2D projection of 3D objects we are looking at. So, in order to get a clear view of N-dimensional data, one needs to have an (N-1)-dimensional retina surface and would see the N-dimensional objects as (N-1)-dimensional projections. Practically, this ain't possible.

Principal Component Analysis generally termed as PCA, is a handy solution for solving the dimensionality problem. Following the above quote by Robert Collier, one has to visualize and understand the data prior to building a model.

PCA helps to remove the features with less variance. Consider a simple example of dataset with only two features. One of the features representing the blackness of hair and the other feature being the weight of an individual. All the data points are from Indians.

In the above image, the variance over the weight axis is high compared to the variance over the x-axis which is very less. Suppose, the idea is to convert 2D to 1D, then the x-axis can be eliminated. All the points over the y-axis can be plotted on a single axis(1D). Through this way, the direction with maximal variance is preserved without the information being lost.

## What if the features are equally distributred over both the axis?

In the above figure, the variance on X-axis and Y-axis is similar. It is not a good idea to eliminate one of the axis in order to reduce it to 1D. Instead draw a straight line(X') through the points where the variance is high, and a line(Y') perpendicular to X'.

 Here, X' is perpendicular to Y'. The variance on X' is much higher than the variance on Y'. The basic idea to convert from 2D to 1D is find X', project all the points onto X' and finally drop Y'.
 
## Finding the unit vector along X'

It's unimportant to find the exact line X', instead compute the direction. Let's assume X' as u<sub>1</sub> [(unit vecor)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector). Let D={x<sub>i</sub>}<sup>n</sup> be the initial dataset and D'={x'<sub>i</sub>}<sup>n</sup> be the transformed dataset where {x'<sub>i</sub>} are the projected points on u<sub>1</sub>.
