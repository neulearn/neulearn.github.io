Isn't it fun creating your own ML model without having expertise in pre-processing of data, feature extration, dimensionality reduction, hyperparameter optimization.......??


### But, what is AutoML????
Automated Machine Learning involves automating the whole process from the preparing of data to the prediction of real-world data. Basically end-to-end process of applying machine learning to real-world problems to generating ML models. Several steps are to be followed prior to selecting a model for a dataset such as data pre-processing, feature engineering, feature extraction, and feature selection. In order to increase the predictive performance, hyperparameter tuning must be performed too. Here, AutoML simplifies the whole application of machine learning especially for a greenhorn in ML.


### What is PyCaret?

<img src="/img/pycaret/pycaret1.jpeg">{: .center-block :}

An open source low-code ML library that helps the user from preparing the data to deploy a model within few lines of code allowing to reach conclusions faster reducing the cylce time from hypothesis to insights. PyCaret is a wrapper around other ML libraries providing a low-code solution.

## Installation

```python
pip install pycaret

# To upgrade existing version
pip install --upgrade pycaret

# To create an conda environment using anaconda prompt
conda create --name envname python=3.6

conda activate envname

pip install pycaret
```

All the dependencies will be installed with pycaret. To view all the dependencies [Click Here](https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret/blob/master/requirements.txt).

Importing required module based on the task. There are 6 available modules in pycaret, if regression module has been imported, then the environment is set up to perform regression task only.

```python
  from pycaret.classification import *  # Classification model
  from pycaret.regression import *      # Regression model
  from pycaret.clustering import *      # Clustering
  from pycaret.anomaly import *         # Anomaly Detection
  from pycaret.nlp import *             # NLP
  from pycaret.arules import *          # Association Rule Mining
```

## Setup Function

Setup is the initial and mandotary step before starting off to build a model. There are few default pre-processing tasks performed by default, in addition pycaret provides other pre-processing features to increase the performance.

#### Syntax for setup

```python
_setup= setup(data,target=' ')    
```

### Default pre-processing tasks

##### Data Type Specification

Helps in determining the data types for the features in the dataset. After the execution of setup, a dialogue appears displaying all the features corresponding to their data type. If the user finds the data to be accurate, user can continue by pressing "Enter" to continue or type "quit", if there are any discrepancies between the data type and feature.

The above figure represents features of [blood](https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret/blob/master/datasets/blood.csv) dataset with data types. 

##### Data Cleaning

Sometimes, user tend to forget cleaning the data i.e. finding the missing values and filling it up but, setup solves this by identifying the missing values. If it's a numerical feature, the missing value may be filled up with mean or median. For categorical features, missing value will be filled up with most frequent value. numeric_imputation and categorical_imputation are the parameters used..
