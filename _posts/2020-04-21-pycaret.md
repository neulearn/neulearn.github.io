Isn't it fun creating your own ML model without having expertise in pre-processing of data, feature extration, dimensionality reduction, hyperparameter optimization.......??


### But, what is AutoML????
Automated Machine Learning involves automating the whole process from the preparing of data to the prediction of real-world data. Basically end-to-end process of applying machine learning to real-world problems to generating ML models. Several steps are to be followed prior to selecting a model for a dataset such as data pre-processing, feature engineering, feature extraction, and feature selection. In order to increase the predictive performance, hyperparameter tuning must be performed too. Here, AutoML simplifies the whole application of machine learning especially for a greenhorn in ML.


### What is PyCaret?

<img src="/img/pycaret/pycaret1.jpeg">{: .center-block :}

An open source low-code ML library that helps the user from preparing the data to deploy a model within few lines of code allowing to reach conclusions faster reducing the cylce time from hypothesis to insights. PyCaret is a wrapper around other ML libraries providing a low-code solution.

## Installation

```python
pip install pycaret

# To upgrade existing version
pip install --upgrade pycaret

# To create an conda environment using anaconda prompt
conda create --name envname python=3.6

conda activate envname

pip install pycaret
```

All the dependencies will be installed with pycaret. To view all the dependencies [Click Here](https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret/blob/master/requirements.txt).

Importing required module based on the task. There are 6 available modules in pycaret, if regression module has been imported, then the environment is set up to perform regression task only.

```python
	from pycaret.classification import *  # Classification model
  from pycaret.regression import *      # Regression model
  from pycaret.clustering import *      # Clustering
  from pycaret.anomaly import *         # Anomaly Detection
  from pycaret.nlp import *             # NLP
  from pycaret.arules import *          # Association Rule Mining
```
