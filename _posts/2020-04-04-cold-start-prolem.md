#### "Aus welcher Zeit bist du? Die frage ist nicht, aus welcher Zeit, sondern aus welcher welt."

These are the final words between Louis Hofmann and Lisa Vicari in Dark series which means What time did you come from? The question isn't what time, the question is what world.

Let us assume I have set up a new account and being an avid fan of sci-fi/thriller genre, I am eagerly anticipating the upcoming season of Dark. On a halcyon and boring day, I opened netflix, I see that the latest season has been automaticaly reccomended without me never searching for it or searching for similar TV shows. But, I was wondering how can Netlfix recommend without any user or item data? This is similar to Cold Start Problem where new users have set up an account and it is an onerous task for the website to reccomend services without having any data on them or their preferences.

## Tackling this problem

#### Content-Based Recommendation using Meta Data
   Items will be recommended based on the users meta data such as geo-location, browser, device used. Nowadays, most of the users, especially teenagers put up their purchased products on social media with the product link.
