**Aus welcher Zeit bist du? Die frage ist nicht, aus welcher Zeit, sondern aus welcher welt.** 

These are the final words between Louis Hofmann and Lisa Vicari in Dark series which means What time did you come from? The question isn't what time, the question is what world.

Being a freak about sci-fi/thriller genre, I'm eagerly anticipating the release of Dark season 3. Let's consider the later season would come out this very minute, and I have no other option but to take up a new account. I would also be eager to watch other movies/shows in a similar genre, but how would Netflix recommend me the new items?

This analogy can be extended to e-commerce platforms, which is generally termed as Cold Start Problem.
Cold Start Problem arise when new users or new items been added to e-commerce site. Initially, when an user(u) creates a new account in any of the e-commerce site, the user wouldn't have provided any data. The same goes with a new item(i) too. This is an onerous task for the recommender systems to provide the new user with a set of items without any browsing or purchasing history.
