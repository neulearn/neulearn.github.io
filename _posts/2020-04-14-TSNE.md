State of Art dimensional reduction technique for visualization.

t-SNE stands for T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding(hard to remember though:< ) developed by Laurens van der Maaten and Geoffrey Hinton. It is non-linear reduction technique which helps in embedding high dimensional data in 2-D or 3-D space for visualization.

Looking at the write-up on Principal Component Analysis, PCA was not doing well except for '0' with the MNIST dataset in 2-D. It was hard to visualize and distinguish between the other numbers. PCA tries to preserve the global structure of data whereas t-SNE preserves local structure too.

## Understanding Neighbourhood and Embedding

In the above figure, consider a point as x<sub>i</sub> in the red cluster. The cluster represents the neighbourhood of x<sub>i</sub>(N(x<sub>i</sub>)). 

### N(x<sub>i</sub>)={ x<sub>j</sub> such that x<sub>i</sub> and x<sub>j</sub> are geometrically close.
Here, N(x<sub>i</sub>) contains all the points present in the red cluster as they are close to x<sub>i</sub>.
