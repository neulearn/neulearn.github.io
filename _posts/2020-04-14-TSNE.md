State of Art dimensional reduction technique for visualization.

TSNE stands for T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding(hard to remember though:( ) developed by Laurens van der Maaten and Geoffrey Hinton. It is non-linear reduction technique which helps in embedding high dimensional data in 2-D or 3-D space for visualization.

Looking at the write-up on Principal Component Analysis, PCA was not doing well except for '0' with the MNIST dataset in 2-D. It was hard to visualize and distinguish between the other numbers. PCA tries to preserver the global structure of data whereas t-SNE preserves local structure too.
