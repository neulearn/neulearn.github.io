State of Art dimensional reduction technique for visualization.

TSNE stands for T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding(hard to remember though:( ) developed by Laurens van der Maaten and Geoffrey Hinton. It is non-linear reduction technique which helps in embedding high dimensional data in 2-D or 3-D space for visualization.
