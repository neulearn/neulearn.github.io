LinkedIn is a social networking service to showcase one's interests, education, skills, and experience which helps in connecting and strengthening professional relationships with others from different parts of the world. 

We see daily numerous posts on LinkedIn by someone:
- sharing a new job offer.
- posting new job opportunities.
- sharing experience with a company.
- advertising the organization and many more.
